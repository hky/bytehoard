  UPGRADING BYTEHOARD
  ===================

Please note that you can only upgrade from 2.1 Alpha to 2.1 Beta.
Support from upgrading from 2.0.x will appear in the next release.

To upgrade from 2.1 Alpha:
 - Delete all files in the alpha directory apart from config.inc.php, the 
   cache/ directory and the filestorage/ directory.
 - Copy the new files from the beta archive into the old directory.
   You need not worry about overwriting anything; config.inc.php does
   not exist in release archives and the filestorage/ and cache/ directories
   are empty.
 - Browse to http://your-server/bytehoard-dir/install.php.
 - Accept the license if you agree and click 'Upgrade'. Select '2.1 Alpha'
   and read the warnings and information. Click 'Upgrade' to upgrade.
 - Once the upgrade is complete you may use the system as before.
