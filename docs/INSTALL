  INSTALLING BYTEHOARD
  ====================

To install ByteHoard 2.1:
 
 - Unpack the archive to a directory under your webserver's document root.
 - Change the permissions on the whole ByteHoard directory tree so that the 
   webserver can write to the files and directories.
 - Browse to http://your-server/bytehoard-directory/install.php

Follow the instructions that appear onscreen on the installer. They are pretty self-explanatory; 
if you find that the system fails its check on files' permissions then check to see if the 
permissions really are set right.

If the system will not accept config.inc.php as being writable then create a blank file
called config.inc.php and set the permissions appropriately; this should solve the problem.

Once the install is finished YOU MUST DELETE INSTALL.PHP! If you leave it then it presents a massive
security risk to your system.

You are of course welcome to ask for help on the ByteHoard forums, or submit a bugreport or feature
request on the ByteHoard tracker (can be found at http://bytehoard.org).

For upgrade instructions see UPGRADE.

Have fun unsing ByteHoard.
