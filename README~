  ByteHoard 2.1
  Epsilon Release
  
  27/5/2006
  
  This is a security and bugfix release, fixing two major flaws as well as incorporating all the
  patches that I've made over the last few months. Oh, and updated logos.
  
  As many of you know BH3 is on the way, so this may be the last release (but if more flaws rear
  their ugly heads, it may not). 
  
  For more information, as always, see the (newly redesigned) (at the time of writing) http://bytehoard.org
  
   
  --- Installation ---
  
  For an installation, extract the archive, set the permissions on the resulting
  directory tree so your webserver can write to the files and browse to 
  http://yourserver.com/bytehoard/install/ (note it is no longer install.php).
  
  Follow the instructions.
  
  Please take down the administrator password on the final page, even if it's only
  until you change it.
  
  --- Upgrade ---
  
  For an upgrade, first backup the old bytehoard directory and database
  and then erase all files from the old directory apart from config.inc.php, filestorage/
  and cache/.
  
  Then browse to http://yourserver.com/bytehoard/install/ and click 'Upgrade' on the menu.]
  
  --- Donations ---
  
  Donations are very welcome, as always. Why not lighten your wallet and cheer up an
  open source developer? I spend too much time on this, so if you feel I should be in some
  way rewarded for my efforts, visit the website at http://www.bytehoard.org/v4/?page=donate
