# Installation

For an installation, extract the archive, set the permissions on the resulting
directory tree so your webserver can write to the files and browse to
http://yourserver.com/bytehoard/install/ (note it is no longer install.php).

Follow the instructions.

Please take down the administrator password on the final page, even if it's
only until you change it.

# Upgrade

If you are upgrading from 2.1 Gamma or newer then just overwrite the current
files with the contents of the archive, as there are no database changes.

For an upgrade from an earlier version, first backup the old bytehoard
directory and database and then erase all files from the old directory apart
from config.inc.php, filestorage/ and cache/.

Then browse to http://yourserver.com/bytehoard/install/ and click 'Upgrade' on
the menu.
